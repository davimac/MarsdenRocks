# MarsdenRocks
I'm trying to make a website for he 1st time. I've never made one and don't know how to do it, My plan is to sell rocks that I find at the beach near my house. It sounds crazy, but some of these rocks are really beautiful, and I think some people in the world who don't live near the sea might appreciate them and want to buy them.
